## Built With

* Ruby 2.4.2
* Tested with Rspec 3.8
* One gem depency to generate random words called....[random-word](https://rubygems.org/gems/random-word/versions/1.3.0).


## Getting Started

We need to install the depency before getting started 

```
bundle install
```

We can then start the game by executing the runner.rb file:

```
ruby runner.rb
```

## Running the tests

We have two classes : Game and RandomString available under the lib folder. And we have their respective test files under the spec folder.  

In order to run the test, just type rspec in terminal and press Enter:

```
rspec
```

A series of green dots show that all the tests have passed.
